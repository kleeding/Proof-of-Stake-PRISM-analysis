# Proof-of-Stake-PRISM-analysis

This respository contains the collection of models described and analysed in my thesis using the probabilistic model checking tool PRISM.

Each folder contains:
- One or more `/<name>.pm` files describing the model.
- A `/properties.pctl` file describing the properties in PRISMs property specification language.

# Running models in PRISM
- Download and install PRISM: https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/download.php
- Open a `/<name>.pm` model in the PRISM GUI
- Open the `/<properties.pctl` property file
- Verify or experiment with properties

For more information on using the PRISM tool please refer to the [PRISM manual](https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/manual/RunningPRISM/StartingPRISM).
